## Overview

This repository contains the analysis scripts and data used in the manuscript titled "Quantitative vs. Qualitative Outcomes: A Longitudinal Study of Risk and Ambiguity in Monetary and Medical Decision-Making." The analysis was conducted to examine how individuals make decisions under risk and ambiguity in both monetary and medical contexts.

## Repository Structure

-   **`Medical_DM_main.m`**: The main script to run the analysis. Executing this script will generate  the figures.
-   **`Medical_DM_figures/`**: This folder contains the generated figures in SVG format. These figures correspond to the visualizations of the analysis results as they appear in the manuscript.
-   **`Medical_DM_data/`**: This folder holds the raw data used in the analysis. The data includes the experimental results that were analyzed to explore decision-making behavior.

## Running the Analysis
